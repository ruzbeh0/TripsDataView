This mod addes a few graphs showing information about the trips that cims take. These include: transit passengers per hour, trips purpose per hour, and commute times information. The menu with these options can be accessed by clicking on the magnifying glass icon on the top left.

## Transit Passengers

Trip type is classified in four categories which are explained below. The number of trips by type is collected from the game every half hour and a file is created for the day at 11:30 pm (game time).
* **Home Based Work:** This include trips from Home to Work and from Work to Home.
* **Home Based School:** This include trips from Home to School and School to Home.
* **Home Based Other:** This consists of trips that start or end at home and go to or are from anyplace that is **not** work or school. This will include trips from home to shopping or leisure.
* **Non Home Based:** All trips that don't have home as the origin or destination.

## Trips Purpose

Some of the citizen purposes - as defined in the game, are collected an added to a file every half hour. Not all purposes are included, but some such as GoingToWork, GoingHome, GoingToSchool are included.

## Commute Time Frequency Distribution

Frequency distribution of commute time for all workers. The data is grouped in 15 minute bins and the file is generated around midnight every day.

## Commute

* Number of passengers in transity by mode (bus, tram, subway, and train)
* Number of passengers waiting for transit and the average passenger waiting time is saved to the csv file every 30 minutes.
